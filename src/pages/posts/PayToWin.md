> Pay to be a better gamer

Pay to win mechanics were introduced into video games around the late 2000's to early 2010's as a way to profit post sale of a major game release. This concept was introduced to progress players faster at the expense of other players who can not afford to spend a portion of their income to keep up. Another issue that comes into gaming with the introduction of Pay To Win is balance. In multiplayer, games are difficult to balance in part because of the different dynamics such as weapon or class balance depending if the game is a shooter or an mmorpg adding a pay to win item to those systems is planned but robust testing is hardly included. An instancce of this is Star Citizen an mmorpg set in Space where by a player can buy better ships that allow for faster mining, more weapons and so on.
