> Release unfinished games at full price

One of the most frustrating things that has reoccured in video games is the "Fix It Later" mentality that has plagued the industry. To expand on this, there have been a record number of games that are released in recent years that do not meet playable standards or are missing features that were promised and then dropped before release. These games are then promised to be fixed but have poor retention rate of players that the game begins to be abandoned. One notable reoccurance of this is Halo and dropping split screen in Halo 5 and Infinite. The worst offender of an unplayable game is the release of Cyberpunk 2077 which wass so bad that retailers offered full refunds for the game.
