> Why is there liitle changes

Video game developers and Publishers are re-releasing old video games with a new paint job but this is not always the case. Konami as of 2023 released a port of their beloved Metal Gear Solid games called Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 that contained games from the 1987 release to 2004 Snake Eater. The release has recieved very little love by the community as the game adds no improvements either graphically or mechanically. Looking at Re-releases as a hold many publishers are releasing old IPs instead of investing in new IPs. Recently we have seen re-releases with the Resident Evil series, Halo with the Master Chief Edition, and the Final Fantasy series. Now to be fair Microsoft and Square Enix have worked on sequels to Halo and Final Fantasy with Final Fantasy 16 recieving a lot of praise for it story and Enivornment but the release of Halo Infinite was very rocky and has taken over a year to fix their multiplayer.
